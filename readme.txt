== Description ==
Speakol has created plugins that provide media publications, content providers, popular brands and start-ups an enhanced user interaction with topical media content and new product launches.

Speakol - Speak Out Loud - was originally launched in 2012 as 'Naqeshny' (meaning debate with me in Arabic), in the midst of the Egyptian Revolution. It was designed as a free, democratic and open platform that facilitated healthy and critical political debates and discussions around socio-political conditions within the country.

With a 400k+ strong user base, the name change and relaunch corresponds to Speakol’s vision of going global.

Our priorities are to provide a unique service to media content publishers and brands in the form of three plugins: Debates (debate between two presented sides to a story), Argument Boxes (voting up or down on a topic) and Comparisons (discussion based on up to four options on any topic). Learn more [here](http://www.speakol.com/).

We have recently developed the Argument Box plugin for WordPress users for seamless integration into your CMS or blog. The remaining plugins development (debates and comparisons) is in progress.
